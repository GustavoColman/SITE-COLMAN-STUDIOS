                <h2>drawing has been present in my life since I was three years old, since I was a child, I created characters and put them in stories, drawing everything with a ballpoint pen in a sketchbook, and soon after, I showed everything to my classmates, who they followed these stories monthly, we took time during recess so everyone could look at my drawings, nowadays, this audience has become larger, with more than 1000 views on the reading platforms "tapas" and "fliptru", amon is the work which I am currently dedicated to, although I have left a long hiatus, Colman Studios has around 5000 followers on Facebook, with plans to expand to other platforms, here are some illustrations I made in recent years, they are a little outdated , but I intend to update this page with new works.</h2>
